# Gork Plugin

This plugin just responds with "yeh" to a list of configurable requests.

That's *literally* all it does.

Heavily inspired by [@natalie.sh](https://bsky.app/profile/natalie.sh)'s Bluesky bot of the [same name](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fwvdvvwstpxpftnbnjiwcsux) ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/espeon/gork))

(If for whatever reason you'd like this taken down Natalie, open an issue and I'll be more than happy to facilitate 🙂‍↕️)

## Configuration

The bot can be easily configured in the plugin's `config.yml` file, allowing you to:

- Change the prefix for the bot (i.e. `@gork` -> `@cahtgtp`)
- Add / remove trigger phrases for the bot
- Enable / disable coloured `@{username}` for the person that triggered it

The config can then be easily reloaded using the `/gorkload` command.
## For the avoidance of doubt...
This plugin does *not* utilize *any* machine learning or "artificial intelligence" technologies, generative or otherwise. 

Finally, not affiliated with Twitter, xAI, or any derivative / future name those companies / platforms happens to have.
