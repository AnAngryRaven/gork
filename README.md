# Gork Plugin

This plugin just responds with "yeh" to a list of configurable requests.

That's *literally* all it does.

Heavily inspired by [@natalie.sh](https://bsky.app/profile/natalie.sh)'s Bluesky bot of the [same name](https://bsky.app/profile/gork.bluesky.bot) ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/espeon/gork))

(If for whatever reason you'd like this taken down Natalie, open an issue and I'll be more than happy to facilitate 🙂‍↕️)

## Configuration

The bot can be easily configured in the plugin's `config.yml` file, allowing you to:

- Change the prefix for the bot (i.e. `@gork` -> `@cahtgtp`)
- Add / remove trigger phrases for the bot
- Enable / disable coloured `@{username}` for the person that triggered it
